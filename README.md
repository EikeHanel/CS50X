## How to Navigate

1. Each week's project is in its own folder (e.g., `week1/`, `week2/`).
2. Follow the README in each folder for setup and instructions.
3. To run code:
   - Install necessary dependencies (e.g., GCC for C, Python 3, Flask).
   - Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/cs50x-projects.git
     cd cs50x-projects
     ```
